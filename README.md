## Shortest Odd Path

This is the codebase for my master's thesis in Algorithms at the University of Bergen.

The thesis itself explains everything, and is available here: <https://github.com/SteinarSi/DivertingNetworksWithOddPaths>.

Additionally, the pdf is available [here](Diverting%20Networks%20with%20Odd%20Paths.pdf).
