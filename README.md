## Shortest Odd Path
This is the codebase for my master's thesis in Algorithms at the University of Bergen.

The thesis explains everything and is available both as a [PDF](Diverting%20Networks%20with%20Odd%20Paths.pdf) and in [source code](https://github.com/SteinarSi/DivertingNetworksWithOddPaths).

***

#### Prerequisites
The library is written in Rust, which can be installed [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Although not required, if you are looking for an IDE to explore Rust projects like this one, then I will recommend [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust).

#### Build & Run
You may check that the project builds correctly with either `cargo check` or `cargo build`.

Run `cargo test` to run the unit tests.
